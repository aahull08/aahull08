Most recently I built [Bard](https://bard-rr.com/), a session replay tool for small eCommerce businesses. Users can record, store, replay and analyze user sessions, allowing them to debug and optimize their user interface and conversion funnels.

Bard was built using React, Nods.js, Clickhouse, RabbitMQ, Docker, and AWS.
